# TaskandLog is an update version of both PassdownLog and TaskAssignment programs for SunWatch written in C# and XAML utilizing the .NET MAUI framework. 
# An SQLite database is utilized for application data in the program instead of text files. 
# The application first opens into the passdown log portion.
